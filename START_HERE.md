## 💡 PRO TIPS

### Performance
- Scans complete in 1-3 seconds
- GitHub repos take longer (30-90s)
- Limit to first 20 files for speed

### Accuracy
- Bandit is highly accurate
- Few false positives
- Always review results

### Sharing
- Safe to scan public repos
- Don't upload sensitive code
- Local scanning = private
